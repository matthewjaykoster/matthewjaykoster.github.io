                        <p>
                            For the past 11 years, I’ve honed my engineering skills and leveraged my technical expertise
                            to grow into a passionate people leader.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my most recent role as <b>Software Development Manager</b>, I had the privilege of
                            leading a talented team of 12+ engineers, helping them grow both personally and
                            professionally. Beyond managing the team, I collaborated closely with a broader group of 40
                            engineers, 2 peer managers, and my director, ensuring alignment on business processes and
                            goals. I worked with technical leaders to define strategies, implement feedback loops
                            between our back-office teams and business functions, and, of course, keep our clients
                            happy. My two primary focuses were converting implicit key processes into documented,
                            explicit ones and building strong connections with my engineers—drawing on my own experience
                            as a hands-on technical contributor to ensure everything ran smoothly.

                            As <b>Team Lead, Connected Products</b>, I led a team of 5 individuals, fostering their
                            personal and professional development and guiding them toward success. Simultaneously, I
                            took ownership of crucial business and technical processes across a broader team of 10,
                            collaborating with peers throughout the organization. Aligning the team's vision, I worked
                            in partnership with architects and engineers to drive execution and implementation. Despite
                            managerial responsibilities, I remained hands-on, delivering expert-level code and technical
                            architectures for various clients.

                            maintaining, and delivering applications interfacing with clients and connecting to Internet
                            of Things devices. I specialized in architecting, creating, and maintaining microservices
                            based in the AWS Cloud. This involved multiple connected products, web clients, and mobile
                            clients, utilizing a suite of technologies such as API Gateway, CloudFormation, CloudFront,
                            CloudWatch, DynamoDB, IoT Core, Lambda, and NodeJS.

                        <p><b>Trustee Scholarship Recipient:</b> I had the honor of being awarded the prestigious
                            Trustee Scholarship, the highest-ranking scholarship for academic achievement. Due to my
                            efforts, I was awarded this honor every semester until graduation. This recognition reflects
                            my commitment to excellence in my studies.</p>

                            Computer Science Department. My focus was on computer security education, where I immersed
                            myself in testing and learning various security tools. Subsequently, I applied this
                            knowledge to construct engaging lessons and labs, empowering others to delve into the world
                            of computer security.
